## import-directory [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raymondsze/import-directory.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/raymondsze/import-directory.svg?branch=master)
<p>Same as <a href="import-directory">require-directory</a></p>
<p>But support to use import and export default syntax in your file inside the directory.</p>
## Install
<p><b>npm install --save require-directory import-directory</b></p>

## How it works
<p>If we use export default inside the directory with <a href="import-directory">require-directory</a>, the result will become like that..</p>
```javascript
{
	model1: {
		default: {
			name: 'Model1'
		}
	},
	model2: {
		default: {
			name: 'Model2'
		}
	}
}
```
<p>Because export default is same as module.exports = {default: ....}.</p>
<p>But what we want is </p>
```javascript
{
	model1: {
		name: 'Model1'
	},
	model2: {
		name: 'Model2'
	}
}
```
<p>The logic behind is just change the 'visit' option provided by <a href="import-directory">require-directory</a>.</p>
<p>Note: There the object that export other than <b>export default</b> like <b>export {... as ...}</b> or just <b>export ....</b> will be ignored. </p>

## How to use
<p> as usual as <a href="import-directory">require-directory</a>, but change the import statement
```javascript
import importDirectory from 'import-directory';
export default importDirectory(module);
```
